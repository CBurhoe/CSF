TODO: add information about contributions of team member(s)
Implemented the createuint256, createuint265_from_uint32, and getbits functions by myself.
Also implemented the add, subtract, and negate functiosn by myself (misunderstood what was included in MS1).

Implemented the entire project by myself

I could not get either of the rotate functions to work correctly. I tried one approach with both,
and then started a new approach with the left rotate function, but it would not function properly.
